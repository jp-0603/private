  Hi there welcome to my website or should I say our website. One thing that sucks about a card is that if you ever want to read it, you would have to go and get it. Instead of having a traditional card and having me write all the things I love about you, I’ve decided to create a website and post it online. And with a website, you will be able to access it whenever and wherever you want. Another goal that I hope I accomplish by the end is for this website to be here whenever you are feeling down or whenever you’re just bored, you can come onto this site and feel better. On a final note, I love you baby. Happy reading <3

      <p>You are always there for me whenever I am down or need help. You are always by my side listening to my thoughts and/or problems and you always try to offer help or anything else that will make me better. I feel comfortable talking to you about anything because I know you'll listen and offer help if I need it. I love that you always make me feel that I am loved and appreciated and I hope I’m doing the same for you. </p>

      <p>There is not too many people that I know that can always make me laugh but you are definitely one of those people. And it’s still so surprising me to this day because you are a woman. It seems like whenever we are together either on the phone or in person, we are always laughing about something. I love to crack jokes with you. I especially love to make the jokes about animals ;)</p>

      <p>I love to just look into your eyes and think to myself “damn I’m really lucky” you are so beautiful baby. I love just looking at you with your beautiful smile. Your smile is so contagious it just makes me smile. You make me feel all nervous inside whenever I go to pick you up because I’m thinking to myself no way I’m hell ima mess up this chance with a baddie like you. I know you are insecure about your appearance but baby I love you for who you are and you do not need make up to be attractive. You are already attractive. I love you for who you are. No makeup bs.</p>

      <h4>Place: <span> Willowbrook Mall</span></h4>


    <div class="paragraph">      
      <p>A lot of the things you go through in your life is hard baby. A lot of the time I just let you vent to me whenever you are going through something but I’m also listening. I commend you for putting through all the bs that you go through at home, work, and school. You are really resilient and I can’t imagine how difficult it is for you. And yet, you are still pushing through. You are going to work almost every day. You are going to school almost every day. And on top of that you have to go home and do whatever you need to do and you do it. And you've recently started going to therapy to better yourself. You took that first step and I am so proud of you for that. Sure you complain most of the time about stuff, but who wouldn’t baby. You are really strong and I hope you keep staying that way. You’ve come a long way from that bitch that I knew from high school. I hope you can finally get a rest soon and have some peace and fun. If there’s anything I can do to help you, let me know please.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, I hope your dumbass is not crying. If you are crying, you are a dumbass and you have dumbass sydrome. If you are not crying, I guess you are still a dumbass. (jk) I love you baby. I hope you appreciated all of what I had to say to you and my gifts. I feel like I got a majority of my thoughts down but every day there is always something I want to add and I'll be here forever. You are probably going to be mad I got you gifts but oh well I guess I love you too much. When I knew you were making a card for me, I've decided to do this and try to one up you. Maybe I haven't one upped you yet because of the amazing card that I know I am going to get. If you think I did one-up you, haha. In conclusion (again), you are the most beautiful person I know and I am happy to call you my girlfriend. I love you my passenger princess. </p>
